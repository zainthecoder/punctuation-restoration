If your into space this is the Calendar for you.
Awesome pictures!
Great wall art and information for space exploration minded people.
As always, it is a quality calendar full of very interesting space-related photos and information.  I love it.  I buy a new one every year.
This is a fantastic calendar. This is my third year purchasing it. It is sturdy and well put together and has a bunch of awesome information in it.
It's great, I get it every year.
2015 will be my 3rd year, looking forward to it! I always enjoy flipping toothed next month. The desk calendar is also great.
My son loves this every year!
A great calendar for the space or science enthusiast.  Ever month includes lots of wonderful astonomical photographs and interesting information on verious astonomical subjects.
Lots and lots of info
I love all the space facts that this calendar has, one of the best space calendars that I have found.
Hung it in a high school class room. Big hit with the students
This is a must for every astronomy lover it has beautiful pictures and lot of other information too.
Nice printing. Lovely images. Useful information.
Very nice and delivered in a box which kept the calendar flat and un-creased and new. Nice pictures and detail.
I have been buying this, and the desk calendar as well, for years. It is beautifully done, filled with interesting facts and easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone.
Each page is full of great info. Great addition for space enthusiast.
One of the coolest purchases I've ever made. I'll absolutely be getting next year's calendar as well. All the extra cool facts and information about everything space-related make every day interesting. There are even "this day in space history" tidbits on most squares, moon phase indicators on every day, monthly sky guides for viewing various planets and other interesting celestial bodies, and even coordinates for telescopes. You'll learn something new every day for sure if you have this calendar! 10/10, would absolutely reccomend
Great pictures and useful information.
This thing is Big!  It's a bunch of beautiful space photos.  We belong in Space.  Going there is more money than I care to spend, more than I could ever afford, and likely more than I can crowdfund.  This shows your support for space activities.  As always, exploration pays back way more than it costs, and this calendar helps support people who believe in the future as limitless, not a place to hide but a place to rush toward.

Maybe the Affordable Space Travel Act will make it free.  Then we can all go there several times a year, right?  I can't wait. But I have to, so for the moment I have a gorgeous calendar on my wall.

Buy it.  You won't be disappointed.
While the item is a larger format as claimed, the actual calendar itself is not. The bottom half is not all calendar.  If you're a space buff, you will probably like this; however, if you were looking for a balanced calendar that also highlights holidays and provides ample space for writing, this is not it.  The date areas have the moon phases and  lots of anniversaries including birthdays of people you probably never heard of.
I got this for someone else. It will be hung in his garage
Its a big calendar! Awesome illustrations and facts. I like it a lot.
Quick delivery, great item, Thanks!
Way to much stuff on the pages leaves a small calendar with very fine print.
This is an amazing calendar!  Filled with information.about space.  It is extra large, and I can't say enough positive things about it.
The calendar is awesome!  It's large, colorful and full of beautiful photos and facts.
Tons of great space science facts, huge colorful photos, and a good mix of history and current/future exploration endeavors.
Great stuff.
Fabulous calendar -- bought two copies for my kids; they LOVE them.  Chock full of amazing images, fun space facts, phases of the moon, etc.  A really inspiring calendar!
My husband LOVES this calendar. It's nice and big, great graphics, and of course he loves all the info in it. A quality product!
Beautiful pic's, excellent info!
This is a fabulous calendar for anyone interested in outer space! The pictures are amazing and the information on each month is very interesting!
It looks good. I purchased  it for my step-son who is majoring in physics and he has an interest in astronomy.
